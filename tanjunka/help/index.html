<h2><a name="What is Tanjunka">What is Tanjunka</a></h2>
<p>Tanjunka is a program for making it simpler to post entries with photos to 
your blog.&nbsp; Typically when you want to post a photo you have to manually 
upload it, often you have to manually prepare it before hand an a separate piece 
of software before you upload it, both of those steps take time, time that would 
be better spent being creative and updating your blog.</p>
<p>With Tanjunka you just start typing, drag or paste some images in and it will 
automatically prepare them for your blog.&nbsp; Pick Post and you&#39;re done.</p>
<h2><a name="Getting Started">Getting Started</a></h2>
<p>If this is your first time using Tanjunka you need to setup info for your 
blog.</p>
<h3><a name="Setting up your first Service">Setting up your first service</a>:</h3>
<p>From the menus pick Post-&gt;Services... to bring up the Services form.&nbsp; 
Click the &quot;Add...&quot; button and select the service that matching your blog software.&nbsp; 
If a matching service is not listed it might be possible to use a compatible 
service.&nbsp; Check your blog's instructions for more information. For a 
particular service follow the corresponding instructions below</p>
<h4><a name="First-Movabletype">Movabletype</a>:</h4>
<p>You may be able to use this service for movabletype compatible blogs as well.</p>
<p>Fill out the following fields.</p>

<p>Flickr is NOT a blog service, it is a Photo service.&nbsp; If you are using a 
blog service that does not support photos directly, for example Blogger or Live 
Journal, then you can setup Tanjunka to post pictures on Flickr and they will 
appear on your blog but first you need to setup your blog so select the matching 
service above.</p>
<h3><a name="Setting up your first Post Set">Setting up your first Post Set</a>:</h3>
<p>If you have already setup a service and the &quot;Services&quot; window is still open 
click &quot;OK&quot; to close it.</p>
<p>Now from the menus pick &quot;Post-&gt;Post Sets...&quot; then click &quot;Add...&quot;</p>
<p>A Post Set is a combination of a blog service and a photo service.&nbsp; If 
you are using a blog service that directly supports photos, for example 
movabletype, then both services may be the same.&nbsp; If you are using a blog 
service that does not support photos directly then you can use a different 
service, for example <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a>, to host your 
images.&nbsp; In either case, for now lets just deal with the blog part, not the 
photo part.</p>
<p>The only thing you should have to do is enter a name for this post set.&nbsp; 
For example, &quot;Gregg&#39;s Food Blog&quot; then click &quot;OK&quot; then click &quot;Close&quot; to close the 
Post Set window.</p>
<h3><a name="Posting your first Entry">Posting your first Entry</a>:</h3>
<p>Click where it says &quot;Enter a Title&quot;, delete that text and enter a title.&nbsp; 
For example &quot;My First Post from Tanjunka&quot;.&nbsp; Click &quot;Type an Entry Here 
or Drag and Drop Some Images&quot;, delete that text and type an entry like &quot;I&#39;m 
testing out Tanjunka.&quot;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the window click &quot;Post&quot;.&nbsp; When the Post Sets window 
appears make sure the checkbox next to your post set is checked then click &quot;Post 
To&quot;.&nbsp; If everything went well your post should have appeared on your blog. 
Open your browser and navigate to your blog to see.</p>
<p>Some services take a few moments to update so if you don&#39;t see the results 
immediately wait a few moments and pick refresh in your web browser.&nbsp; If it 
still doesn&#39;t show up see the troubleshooting section</p>
<h3><a name="Setting up a Photo service">Setting up a Photo service</a>:</h3>
<p>If you are using a service that directly supports photos like movabletype you 
can skip ahead to <a href="#Posting your first Photo">Posting your first Photo</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a service that does not directly support photos visit the
<a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr website</a> and sign up for an account . 
Once you have your account setup go into Tanjunka, from the menus pick 
Post-&gt;Services..., click &quot;Add...&quot;, choose &quot;Flickr&quot; and click &quot;OK&quot;.&nbsp; Fill 
out the following fields</p>
<table>
  <col class="col1">
  <col class="col2">
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Name:</td>
    <td>a name for you to identify this service with.&nbsp; For 
    example &quot;Colin's Flickr&quot;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E-Mail:<br>
    Password:</td>
    <td>The e-mail and password you use to log into flickr</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Click &quot;OK&quot; then Click &quot;OK&quot; again to exit the Services window.&nbsp; Bring up 
the Post Sets window by picking &quot;Post-&gt;Post Sets...&quot; from the menus.&nbsp; Click 
the name of the Post Set you created previously. Where it says &quot;Photo Service:&quot; 
use the drop down list to select the flickr service you just created.&nbsp; 
Click &quot;OK&quot; and then &quot;Close&quot; to exit the Post Sets window</p>
<h3><a name="Posting your first Photo">Posting your first Photo</a>:</h3>
<p>Select &quot;File-&gt;New&quot; from the menus. If you are asked if you are sure pick 
&quot;Yes&quot;. Enter a title, for example, &quot;My first photo from Tanjunka&quot; and enter some 
text, for example, &quot;Tanjunka makes posting photos easy!&quot;.&nbsp; Now, open 
Windows Explorer or Double Click on My Documents and navigate to some photos you 
have.&nbsp; These are often found in the My Pictures folder.&nbsp; Drag and Drop 
a photo on to Tanjunka.&nbsp; Alternatively, select the photo, pick copy, then 
go to Tanjunka, click somewhere in your entry and pick &quot;Paste&quot;. The photo should 
appear in Tanjunka. It will automatically be scaled to 400x300 pixels which is 
the default size for most blogs.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the window click &quot;Post&quot;.&nbsp; When the Post Sets window 
appears make sure the checkbox next to your post set is checked then click &quot;Post 
To&quot;.&nbsp; If everything went well your post with your photo should have appeared on your blog. 
Open your browser and navigate to your blog to see.</p>
<p>Some services take a few moments to update so if you don&#39;t see the results 
immediately wait a few moments and pick refresh in your web browser.&nbsp; If it 
still doesn&#39;t show up see the troubleshooting section</p>

<p align="left">If you&#39;ve used any Windows software before most of it should be

Tanjunka.</p>

<p align="left">The first drop down list in the toolbar, the one that says &quot;G&#39;s 
Blogger&quot; in the image above is the list of post sets you have setup in Tanjunka.&nbsp; 
You can one of them here to change which settings are being used to edit the 
current post.&nbsp; The most important place this comes up is under the 
&quot;Options&quot; tab.&nbsp; Different services have different options so before you 
post if you need any special settings, for example categories or keywords then 
you should click on the &quot;Options&quot; tab and then select the Post Set for which you 
want to edit options.</p>
<p align="left">Since Tanjunka supports posting to more than one blog at the 
same time you can edit the options for every post set you have.</p>
<p align="left">Otherwise, generally you type a title, type some text for your 
entry and choose post.&nbsp; You can use the icons on the toolbar to help you 
format your entry.&nbsp; The icons on the toolbar from left to right are as

<a name="Undo/Redo/Revert">Undo, Redo, Revert</a></h4>
<p align="left">
Undo and Redo should be pretty self explanatory. Revert sets the entire picture 
back to the original image with no cropping and no color adjustments.</p>
<p align="left">
Note: Undo and Redo are remembered for each photo.&nbsp; In other words, if you 
adjust the hue of image1 then adjust the saturation of image2, then go back to 
editing image1 if you click undo you&#39;ll undo the editing of image1.&nbsp; Image2 
will not be effected. </p>

<h2><a name="Using Custom Style Sheets">Using Custom Style Sheets</a></h2>
<p>You can setup a custom style sheet for any blog service you have configured.&nbsp; 
In the settings area check the &quot;Use Custom Style Sheet&quot; checkbox, then click 
&quot;Browse...&quot; and find your style sheet (CSS file).&nbsp; If you do this you can 
make Tanjunka show your post in the same fonts, sizes, colors and other style 
settings as your individual blogs.<p>You will probably have to edit your CSS 
file.&nbsp; The details of CSS or beyond the scope of this document.&nbsp; 
Tanjunka&#39;s default entry display uses the following styles.<p><div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 2em; background-color: #f0f0ff;">&lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;<div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 2em; background-color: #f0fff0;">&lt;div class=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;<div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 2em; background-color: #fff0ff;">&lt;div class=&quot;blogtitle&quot;&gt;<div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 2em; background-color: #fff0f0;">title</div>&lt;/div&gt;</div><br /><br /><div style="border: 1px dashed gray; padding: 2em; background-color: #fff0ff;">&lt;div

<p>Trouble Posting An Entry:</p>
<p>If you get the error &quot;could not post entry to [____]: fault response contains 
string value where integer expected [fault response: struct mapped to type Fault 
: member faultCode mapped to type Int32]&quot; it&#39;s most likely that you have your 
Encoding set to something other than &quot;Unicode (UTF-8)&quot;.&nbsp; Check the settings 
for the service you are having problems with and try setting the encoding to 
&quot;Unicode (UTF-8)&quot;.</p>
<p>If you get any other error while posting the first thing to check is your 
name, password and XML-RPC path if applicable. If those seem correct click the 
&quot;update&quot; button in the settings for the service you are having trouble with.&nbsp; 
If any error appears again, double check your username, password and XML-RPC 
path.&nbsp; If you are behind a proxy make sure you setup your proxy.&nbsp; The 
&quot;HTTP:&quot; is required as is the port.&nbsp; Example proxy: </p>
