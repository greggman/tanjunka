<h1>Localizing Tanjunka</h1>
<p>The simple explanation is if you have Microsoft Excel, load up the file langs\tanjunka-language-en-us.xml 
then pick &quot;SaveAs&quot; and save it in the same folder with the name changed for your 
language. For example if you are doing a German translation you might name it &quot;tanjunka-language-deutsch.xml&quot;</p>
<p>Now edit the middle column. Most importantly Cell B2, enter a new 
LanguageLabel, for example &quot;Deutsch&quot;.</p>
<p>The next time you run Tanjunka your new language should be available in the 
preferences. (Tools-&gt;Preferences).&nbsp; Any thing you do not translate will 
come from the English file (tanjunka-language-en-us.xml).</p>
<p>If you do not have Microsoft Excel you can instead use Open Office which you 
can download for free from <a href="http://openoffice.org/">
http://openoffice.org</a>. Unfortunately Open Office 1.1 does not support 
Excel&#39;s XML format so there will be no way for you to get your language into 
Tanjunka directly but each .xml file is accompanied by an original .xls file&nbsp; 
You can edit that file in Open Office, save it, send it to me and I can convert 
it for the next release of Tanjunka.</p>
<p>If you make a new language file for Tanjunka please contact me in the
<a href="http://tanjunka.com/tan/forum/">Forums at Tanjunka.com</a> and I&#39;ll try 
to include it in the next release of Tanjunka.</p>
