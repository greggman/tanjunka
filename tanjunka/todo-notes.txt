---------done--------

x find bug where file is local
x icon
x make uploaded image have ext of temp
x must make progress dialog work
x must check abort
x make "need to save" dialog work correctly
x make prefs
  x proxy support!
  x show HTML tabs
  x show log/debug menu
  x make default text disappear?
  x global image size
  x option to autogen upload names (set to default)
    (problem is many people have camera set to DSC00001 everytime)
    so unless we make our own names they will upload over old pics
x about
 x show version
x splash
x check if imagepath is used
x remove test from flickr form
x make publish, allow comments and allow trackback on by default
x menu undo,redo,cut,copy,paste, select all,
x make copy, paste to other program, work

x edit images
  x resize


x fix paste html javascript error
x fix align="right" becoming align="right/"

x make Log.Printn a virtual function:
  When posting, make everything go through delegate

x get originalwidth, height from prog, not HTML
x make flickr put in links
x must check execptions
x must make "publish" change to "re-post"
x "publish" should take you to postset box if more than one postset
x make it do the right thing for the "Type entry " stuff
x when pasting HTML, copy the images local
  (option to leave them)
x make "publish" go to PublishForm if there is more than one postset.

x delete postsets
x delete services
  (walk postsets and remove references to service)
x service extras (category, allow comments)
x add postset selection on toolbar to change visible stuff
x make postoptions be part of each service
x fix resizing bug

x change "publish" to "post"
x size image for real
  x while uploading
  x option to do just after resizing

x edit
x save checkmarks
x lookup blogIDs


x color dropdowns
x paste image

x each blogphotoservice needs an ID.  We can't use the name because if the user
  changes the name the data for that service will get lost
x post to MT
x post images
x remove title from form, put in bottom
x load/save entries
x save images with entry
x html tab

x blogger
x flickr
x make bloggerAPI service separate from a blogger service (blogger service has no XMLRPC link and might use different api)
  x same for MoveableType, make it the metaWeblog API service
    x new moveabletype version might need to check for Atom
x check size of image on way out and re-adjust
x set default size
x copy and paste from photoshop
x clear uploaded flag for pic if it's changed/been edited
x save/load entries
x when reposting, post images if they have been edited
  (means when you store you need to save size/etc or
   when editing you need to mark for re-upload)

* Here's latest the idea

  Just like we copy data to/from the HTML forms we can copy data to/from
  the various blog posting forms so if in publish we have 1 service
  showing there will be 1 body tab, if 2 services then 2 body tabs?

  OR

  On the toolbar there will be a drop down list for the services.
  You can pick any one to change the appearence of the body
